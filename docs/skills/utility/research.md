    # Research Skill
    
    ## Purpose
    
    Conduct structured research on topics, technologies, libraries, patterns, or any subject requiring investigation. Produces documented findings with optional issue creation for actionable items.
    
    ## When to Use
    
    - Evaluating a new technology or library
    - Investigating best practices for a pattern
    - Researching solutions to a problem
    - Comparing alternatives (frameworks, tools, approaches)
    - Understanding external APIs or services
    - Preparing for a design decision
    
    ## Research Modes
    
    ### Quick Research (default)
    Fast investigation using available tools and knowledge.
    
    ```
    /research "FastAPI vs Flask for REST APIs"
    → Quick comparison based on docs and knowledge
    ```
    
    ### Deep Research
    Thorough investigation with documentation lookup, code analysis, and structured output.
    
    ```
    /research deep "Implementing OAuth2 in Python"
    → Detailed findings with examples and recommendations
    ```
    
    ### Comparative Research
    Side-by-side evaluation of alternatives.
    
    ```
    /research compare "pytest vs unittest vs nose2"
    → Feature matrix, pros/cons, recommendation
    ```
    
    ## Research Procedure
    
    ### 1. Scope Definition
    
    Before researching, clarify:
    - **Topic**: What exactly are we researching?
    - **Context**: Why do we need this information?
    - **Constraints**: Time budget, depth required, specific questions?
    - **Output**: What format is most useful?
    
    If scope is unclear, invoke `interview` for one question at a time.
    
    ### 2. Information Gathering
    
    **Sources (in priority order):**
    
    1. **Workspace Context**
       - Existing code patterns
       - Project documentation
       - Constitution constraints
       - Previous research (`project docs`)
    
    2. **Built-in Knowledge**
       - Language/framework documentation
       - Common patterns and best practices
       - Known tradeoffs and gotchas
    
    3. **External Tools (if available)**
       - Web search via MCP tools
       - Documentation lookup
       - API exploration
    
    4. **Code Analysis**
       - Read relevant source code
       - Analyze existing implementations
       - Check test patterns
    
    ### 3. Synthesis
    
    Organize findings into:
    - **Summary**: Key takeaways (1-3 sentences)
    - **Details**: Structured findings
    - **Recommendations**: What to do based on findings
    - **Questions**: What remains unclear
    - **References**: Sources used

    ### Recommendation
    {what to do}
    ```
    
    ## Issue Creation from Research
    
    After research, if actionable items are found:
    
    ```
    📋 Research complete. Found {N} actionable items:
    
    - [FEAT] Implement caching layer (from performance findings)
    - [CHORE] Update dependency to fix vulnerability
    - [DOCS] Document new API integration
    
    Create issues for these? [A]ll / [S]elect / [N]one
    ```
    
    ## Integration with Other Skills
    
    - ****: Research can be triggered from idea enrichment
    - ****: Planning can request research for unknowns
    - ****: Research findings become backlog items
    - **interview**: Used to clarify research scope
    
    ## MCP Tool Integration (Optional)
    
    If MCP tools are available, research can use:
    
    | Tool | Use Case |
    |------|----------|
    | `web_search` | Search for documentation, tutorials, comparisons |
    | `fetch_url` | Retrieve specific documentation pages |
    | `brave_search` | Alternative web search |
    
    **Without MCP tools**: Research uses built-in knowledge and workspace analysis only.
    
    ## Research Confidence
    
    Rate research confidence based on sources:
    
    | Confidence | Sources |
    |------------|---------|
    | **High** | Official docs + code analysis + personal experience |
    | **Medium** | Official docs OR established best practices |
    | **Low** | Community opinions, limited sources, outdated info |
    
    Always state confidence level in recommendations.
    
    ## Examples
    
    ### Quick Research
    ```
    User: /research "Python dataclasses vs pydantic for config"
    
    Agent:
    ## Research: dataclasses vs pydantic for Configuration
    
    ### Summary
    Use **pydantic** for configuration with validation, **dataclasses** for simple data containers.
    
    ### Comparison
    
    | Feature | dataclasses | pydantic |
    |---------|-------------|----------|
    | Validation | ❌ Manual | ✅ Built-in |
    | Type coercion | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
    | JSON parsing | ⚠️ Extra code | ✅ Built-in |
    | Performance | ✅ Faster | ⚠️ Overhead |
    | Dependencies | ✅ stdlib | ❌ External |
    
    ### Recommendation
    For configuration files: **pydantic** (validation is critical for config)
    For internal data: **dataclasses** (simpler, faster)
    
    Confidence: **High** (based on official docs and common practice)
    ```
    
    ### Deep Research with Issue Creation
    ```
    User: /research deep "authentication patterns for REST API"
    
    Agent:
    ## Research: REST API Authentication Patterns
    
    ### Summary
    JWT with refresh tokens is recommended for our use case. Requires 3 implementation tasks.
    
    ### Findings
    [...detailed analysis...]
    
    ### Recommendations
    1. Implement JWT access tokens (15min expiry)
    2. Add refresh token rotation
    3. Store refresh tokens in httpOnly cookies
    
    ---
    
    📋 Research complete. Found 3 actionable items:
    
    - [FEAT] Implement JWT authentication layer
    - [FEAT] Add refresh token rotation
    - [SEC] Implement secure cookie storage for tokens
    
    Create issues for these? [A]ll / [S]elect / [N]one
    ```
